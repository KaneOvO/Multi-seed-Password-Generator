# Multi-seed-Password-Generator

The a priori object of the project is  the password, a string that may contain numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and symbols. 



Ex: peX%6F*"



Instructions: This generator will by default create a password consisting entirely of numbers. Users can check additional options to make the password more complex, including the inclusion of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and symbols. Furthermore, users can modify the generation seed. The 'type seed' will change the characters used to generate the password, while the 'order seed' will change the order of the characters. The minimum length for the password is 4. Upon completion, users can download the password as a txt file.



Satisfies the additional challenges 2 (providing users with the ability to download the generated password) and 3 (using multiple seeds and allowing users to manipulate them).



Asked ChatGPT about how to customize seeds and learned about the seedrandom.js library and how to use it.
